<h1>Hello there</h1>

    <b>Welcome to the REWIKI project, which is created becase, well: Wikipedia is ugly as hell.</b><br>
    The main problem is that wikipedia wasn't updated in years, and not just the lack of nice design, but also the lack of useful features is disturbing.<br>
    This site aims to change that. It it based on many concepts from the internet, some parts mixed together, some parts perfected.
    </p>
    Please note that this app has many drawbacks.
    <li>It is much slower</li>
    <li>It is under construction</li>
    <li>lot of local wikipedias (hu, en , ge) have many different styles making it almost impossibble to style everything correctly.</li>
